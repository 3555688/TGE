We will NOT communicate the contract address through email or Telegram private message. TGE will only start on 16 April 2018, at 16:00 UTC +0. The only method to participate in our token generation event will be contributed to our ONLY ONE smart contract address.

Check the spelling carefully of all channels, website, etc to ensure it is legitimate; “decentralizedml.com” is the correct spelling and domain with only one “i”, ‘Decentralized” instead of “Decentralised”, camouflages & wrong spellings of 1 vs i, o vs c. etc.

Check the admin tag (in conversation) and/or stars (in group info) in DML Telegram Community to identify real admins. Please pay special attention to the spellings of the usernames, the displayed names etc. and beware of any information which doesn’t make chronological sense.

Check the username before talking with anyone in Telegram private messages to ensure you are talking with the real admins. In particular, our real admins will NOT send private messages to your on the TGE address.
